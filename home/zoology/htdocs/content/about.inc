<h1>The rEvolution Project</h1>

<p>The rEvolution project was born in August 2002 as a collaboration between the Cambridge University Museum of Zoology, the Department of Zoology, and CARET, the Centre for Applied Research in Educational Technologies at the University of Cambridge.</p>

<h2>General aim</h2>

<p>The aim of the project is to create an interactive, on-line virtual experience in biological sciences to aid Cambridge University achieve its goal of encouraging disadvantaged, gifted and talented secondary school children to aspire to enter higher education.</p>

<h2>How the project is run. The team and involvement with teachers and students</h2>

<p>In the beginning, from August 2002 and for two months, Martyn Robertson was employed to research computer games technology and to provide ideas as to how to design and structure the site. During this time, and over the first year of the project, Katharine Hartley, the project leader, and Martin Ellwood, a research associate, held focus groups with teachers, student teachers and students to understand how young people might like to use the site and what areas of biological content to include. The team expanded to include Chris Applegate, a computer games programmer and John Uff, a computer games designer, and the first main area of the site (the History of Life) began to be constructed. Joining the team at the beginning of 2003 were Helen Burchmore, a biologist with experience in the computer games industry and Mark Stickley, a computer games programmer.</p>

<p>As material is created, it is tested with the target audience of young people from year 7 through to year 11. In doing so, the team has visited schools in Thetford, Tonbridge, Bristol and Liverpool as well as meeting with many students from across the UK as they visit us in Cambridge. By observing the students as they work with the material, we can discover how effective the material is and what changes we can make. All resulting suggestions and recommendations from students and teachers guide the project's team to make necessary alterations and to ensure the content is suitable and the presentation of information is motivating and usable. We have received some very positive comments from teachers representing a wide range of schools, and subject specialities including science, geography and career teachers. The future development of the site, including ideas and the design of games has benefited greatly from the meetings with students and their teachers.</p>

<h2>Involvement of research scientists and other university staff</h2>

<p>In developing content to use in the interactive scenes and games as well as in the information section, we have frequently engaged with academic researchers and other personnel at Cambridge University for their advice and expertise on the different subjects. We have taken numerous photographs of specimens from both the Zoology and Sedgwick (Earth Sciences) museums and have obtained pictures and photographs from the collections at the Botanical Gardens. In doing so we are providing the public an opportunity to access material which would either not normally be readily accessible or would require a day trip out to view. In addition the specimens and objects enrich the learning content of the site.</p>

<h2>Structure of the site, the biological content</h2>

<p>The team decided to structure the site by creating interactive learning experiences which would enable a full exploration of three areas of biology; the history of life, rainforest environments and genetics and evolution. These were chosen to cover a wide range of topics with overlapping subject material to provide a rich background for a student interested in biology. The first area completed by the team is 'the History of Life' and this was available as the first completed section when the site was launched on the 16th of October 2003. To give visitors to the site a firm background to the subject of natural science, we have retold the history of the emergence of species from the first organisms in the Precambrian 600 million years ago up to the present day. We focus on the co-evolution of plants and animals on land and show examples of fossilised extinct forms as well as those still present today. We would like students to explore the scenes and discover how the plants and animals have changed and adapted over time. When this area has been successfully explored, we unlock a number of games and animations to supplement and enrich this subject, with particular focus on plant evolution and adaptations to land living and the study of fossils; how they are formed, dated and discovered.</p>

<p>The additional learning experiences, the rainforest ecosystem and genetics and evolution are being designed to follow a consistent style similar to the one developed for 'the history of life'. Each section will be accessed through an animated doorway in the lobby area of the site where visitors will be given the opportunity to explore interactive educational scenes based on the biological theme. After this has been successfully explored, a series of games, puzzles and animations will be revealed allowing the player to have fun while solving problems and answering questions in order to develop a deeper understanding of the area of biology being investigated. The design of games and interactive material has been based upon existing computer games technology that young people are familiar and comfortable with. We would like to learn from this vast industry to create inspirational educational content based on the particular areas of biology outlined above. In doing so, we believe we will engage with students who may not benefit from traditional learning methods as well as those who are achieving at school and would like to extend their knowledge of biological science.</p>

<h2>Structure of the site, the information centre</h2>

<p>A separate area of the site is dedicated to information, resources and careers. This is contained within a dungeon-like room which can be entered into from the lobby area of the site through a secret doorway hidden within a bookcase. Within this room a range of information is tucked away for the user to uncover. For the keen student or teacher there is information about the biological content of the games and animations including additional material and how the subject relates to the national curriculum. We provide links to other sites and a bibliography for further reading. For aspiring scientists or those who like to dabble in nature and art, there will be a section on fun biology-based things to do at home or in the classroom. On the desk in the foreground of the room is the access point to 'virtual tours' of the Zoology and Earth Sciences (Sedgwick) museums in Cambridge, where visitors can watch and listen to videos of experts talking about various specimens within each museum. On the wall at the back of the room is a clipboard holding video interviews with a range of people who have chosen to study biology and are using this in their career. This should provide a rich source of material for students to access when they are considering their own career choices. We also provide other career information including what it is like to be a student at Cambridge and how to manage financially when going to university. Finally we provide a section about famous scientists for further reading and a glossary, describing biological terms which can be accessed at any time from the main menu.</p>

<h2>Using the site</h2>

<p>The website is freely accessible to anyone and will be promoted in secondary schools within the UK with the aim of enriching and extending the classroom teaching of biology. In particular, the project will be promoted in schools in locations traditionally considered to be disadvantaged to inspire an interest in biology and raise children's aspirations.</p>

<p>Although the purpose of the project is to inspire gifted and talented but disadvantaged children in biology, it is expected that the site will increase general interest in this subject in all secondary school students, regardless of their intellectual ability. To this end we add incentives as we design games and we intend adding rewards to be collected by the user in the treasure chest within the 'lobby' area.</p>

<p>We are continually adding content and information to the site, but estimate that the site will be completed by late 2004 - early 2005. </p>

<p>The team would be delighted to hear from anyone who would like to be involved in the project or who would like any more information about the site. Perhaps you have an idea for a game or perhaps you can tell us what you like or dislike? Please go to the <a href="index.php?section=contact">Contacts Section</a> to drop us a line.</p>
