<h2>Charles Darwin</h2>

<p>Perhaps most of us could say one thing about Charles Darwin. He is the person we associate with the term 'evolution'.</p>

<p>Some of us could say more than that: </p>

<p>Charles Darwin formed one of the most important theories known to science and indeed life; the theory of evolution through natural selection. This in a nutshell says that the individuals in a population most able to survive in an environment will transmit these qualities to their children, giving them the best chance of survival. Over generations, characteristics will be selected in this manner and traits will evolve that benefit the future organism. Over long periods of time, selection may act on populations to evolve characteristics which will distinguish them from other populations and create a new species. </p>

<p>But what else is known about this great naturalist and thinker?</p>

<p>Let us look at the life of Charles Darwin:</p>

<p>Charles was born on the 12th of February 1809 in Shrewsbury to Susanna and Robert Darwin. His mother was a daughter of Josiah Wedgewood; founder of the Staffordshire china company and his father an influential doctor, practicing in Shrewsbury. As a child, Charles had a great affection for natural history and would pursue it with total absorption. He was an avid collector from an early age and would accumulate any kind of natural object. His father delighted in Charles's interest for science and nature and encouraged his childhood investigations and experiments at home. </p>

<p>Shortly after the devastating effect of his mother's death, Charles was sent to board at Shrewsbury school where he spent most of the rest of his childhood miserable. When Charles turned out to not be a classical scholar, his father decided he should leave the wretched school and attend University in Edinburgh at the age of sixteen, joining his brother in studying for a medical degree. It was his reaction to two botched operations he witnessed; one on a child and both without anesthesia that turned Charles away from medicine forever. Charles spent most of his second year in Edinburgh pursuing natural history and avoiding medical studies. </p>

<p>On discovering Charles's lack of interest in medicine, his father became angry and decided that Charles should head for Cambridge and begin a career with the church.  </p>

<p>At Cambridge though, Charles again swayed away from the studies his father was so keen for him to do and instead spent his time enjoying himself and increasing his knowledge of natural history. He became acquainted with and attended the lectures of the then professor of botany, John Henslow, who inspired Darwin to devote himself to science. But it was under the guidance of the great geologist and teacher Adam Sedgwick (see other great scientists) that Darwin gained expertise in the study of rocks and geological formations, which would be the first step in establishing Charles as a scientist in his own right. </p>

<p>Then in 1831 Charles was presented with the opportunity that would change his life and lead to the development of one of the greatest theories in science. The HMS Beagle was preparing to set sail on a mission to chart the coast of South America and its captain, Robert Fitzroy was looking for a 'gentleman naturalist' to accompany him. In Cambridge, Professor Henslow recommended Charles Darwin for this position and Fitzroy accepted.</p>

<p>To Charles, setting sail on the 7th December 1831 on board the Beagle was the most exciting thing ever to happen to him, even if his father had begrudgingly agreed to the trip. Charles was not the official naturalist on board, that position fell to the surgeon, McCormick. His role was primarily to accompany the Fitzroy, a common practice at a time when captains would not mix socially with the crew but chose a fellow companion of a similar social class and background for a long voyage at sea. </p>

<p>The voyage was to last for five years. For much of this time Charles spent on inland trips in South America while the Beagle tacked up and down the coast of this continent. Darwin studied the geological formations of the Andes, noting how they were gradually being pushed upwards over long periods of time, by the earthquakes that frequently rocked the region. He collected specimens and made many discoveries relating to plants and animals, including the large flightless bird, the rhea. He noted the fossil record of extinct species being similar but often larger in form and structure to the living examples on this continent. But it was the Galapagos Islands, several hundred miles off the west coast of Ecuador, that provided Charles with the natural specimens, which opened his mind to an idea about evolution. It was the discovery of distinct species of finches, each specifically adapted to and living on separate islands that later alerted Darwin to his theory. It seemed unlikely that a God would have created so many distinct species for each separate craggy island. More convincingly, the different species had arisen as descendents of one ancestral form, which had inhabited various islands in small populations and evolved in particular ways to suit the environment of each island.</p>

<p>On returning to England in 1836, Darwin was intent on finding a mechanism to explain evolutionary changes as he saw them. He worked with animal breeders and pigeon fanciers learning how they were able to produce many various types of animal by selective mating for chosen characteristics. Darwin's realization was that there is considerable variation in characteristics in any given population of a species. We only have to look at our own species, to realize that no individual is the same and in fact we exhibit a great range of characteristics; most obviously in size shape and colouration. Animal breeders use this to their advantage by selecting qualities they like in individuals, and breeding these with the knowledge that the characteristics are likely to be inherited by the offspring by heredity. All Darwin needed was a natural model to explain the same selection process breeders use to enhance characteristics in a population. </p>

<p>Charles Darwin's triumph was to realize that it is the struggle for survival in nature that provides the selection pressure on a population. This is termed 'natural selection' and states that only individuals best adapted to the environmental conditions will survive, breed and pass on these traits characteristics to their offspring. On the small isolated islands of the Galapagos, finches best adapted to their specific location survived and bred, leading eventually, over many generations to distinct species of bird on each island. </p>

<p>To Darwin, natural selection did not steer evolution in a particular direction to produce 'better' beings, but merely allowed populations to adapt and survive in their local environment.</p>

<p>Darwin though was living in the world of conservative Victorian England. His theory of evolution through natural selection would clash directly with the 'respectable' society he moved within, who would only except that all creatures are the result of divine creation; the work of God. Darwin's theory portrayed a struggle for life where disasters and death played a role in allowing the best adapted to survive. He also stated it was an immensely slow and natural process. Both these points conflicted directly with the church's idea of creation and the benevolence of God. </p>

<p>As a result, Darwin kept his ideas to himself for many years, but began working on a book to describe them in the 1850s. It was the sudden arrival of a letter from the naturalist, Alfred Wallace in 1858 that precipitated Darwin's will to publish his ideas. Wallace, in Indonesia had independently discovered the theory of evolution by natural selection. What should Darwin do? His lifetime work was about to be 'scooped'. As history tells us, it was a joint reading to the Linnean society in London of both Darwin and Wallace's papers on natural selection that gives both men the credit for this theory. But it was Darwin who subsequently published 'Origin of Species' in 1859, which explained the theory to the public audience of Victorian society. Within a decade, and to Darwin's credit, the book managed to convert the majority of the scientific and even public community and it became widely accepted. This could only be described as revolutionary! But it wasn't until the 20th century with our understanding of genetics that natural selection became a dominant thrust to explain biology. </p>

<p>Later, in 1871, Darwin added to the debate, by publishing a perhaps even more controversial book, 'The Decent of Man', suggesting ideas for the origin of humankind.</p>

<p>Ironically though, in Cambridge, Darwin's great mentor, the geologist Adam Sedgwick, from whom Charles had learned much about geology, stood completely opposed to Darwin's theory. Sedgwick was a deeply religious man and could not contemplate ideas that conflicted with divine creation. But it was also in Cambridge in the 1870s where a research group was established to study Darwinian evolution and where in 1877 Darwin was celebrated by his old university which gave him an honorary degree. The ceremony is infamous in the story of Charles Darwin, who was greeted by crowds of cheering students, who had the good humour to dangle an effigy of Darwin as a monkey from the senate house. </p>

<p>Darwin continued to study and write about his beloved subject, natural history, even publishing a book on the humble earthworm in the latter years of his life.</p>

<p>Charles Darwin led a long and gentle life. He married his cousin Emma Wedgewood and settled with her and their children in the countryside of Down House in Kent. He died at the age of 73 in April 1882 leaving behind one of the greatest contributions to science any individual has ever made.</p>
