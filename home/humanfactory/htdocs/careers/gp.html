<strong>How long have you been a GP?</strong><br>
Since January 2000.<br><br>
<strong>What's your typical day?</strong><br>
It starts at about 9 o'clock when we start seeing patients. I usually come in a bit earlier just to check mail and do a few administration things. Then I start seeing patients at around 9 until midday / 1 o'clock. Then at 1 o'clock I do one or two home visits for people who can't come out to the surgery. And then it starts again at 2 o'clock or 4 o'clock depending on what shift you're doing. If I start at two, I finish at about five with some home visits at the end.<br><br>
<strong>Do jobs differ much across the country?<br>
Is it different to be a GP in London compared to Edinburgh or Manchester for example?
</strong><br>
I think in the cities its probably very similar but compared to people who are working in the countryside in tiny villages I think it's very different because the hospital are far so they have to do a lot more. In rural practises it has to be like a mini casualty, like a mini hospital set up if the hospital is very far which is different from if you work in the city. Many of them would carry defibrillators or nebulisers whereas here we wouldn't do that as the hospital is too close. Also in tiny villages if you only have one GP then he has more responsibilities. He has fewer nights off than in the city because there are more doctors. So from that respect I think it is very different.
<br><br>
<strong>What do you enjoy the most about being a GP?</strong><br>
The contact with the patients. You have a continuity that you often don't have in hospitals. You know the patient over a long period of time and see them getting better / see them getting ill. It's the continuity of care. I found it quite frustrating when I was in Casualty because you see someone, you treat them and you'll never see them again so you never know what's happened to them. It's also allows you to see whether or not you are a good doctor. If you treat people and you never see them again, you never know if what you're doing is right. I think that's what I enjoy the best… continuing the care of people.
<br><br>
<strong>And what do you enjoy least?</strong><br>
Patients who are very demanding so are never happy with what you're offering them . Also difficult patients who are difficult to help: you treat them for why they came in but it's not working or there's always something else. Very often this happens with people who have other problems such as social or housing or psychiatric problems i.e. where I think maybe the problem is not medical. You get a lot of patients like that especially in the city. It's not a medical problem but they have "medicalised" it in a way because they have come here for help. They have headaches but it's not a tumour, it's the housing and the children and you can't help very often.
<br><br>
<strong>What A-Levels did you do?</strong><br>
I did Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics. You don't have to do sciences. You can do languages but then you have to do a conversion course which is one extra year. I think many universities do them now and in this pre-medical year you do sciences. If you do Science A-Levels then you can go straight into medicine without doing the pre medical year. I think you need Mathematics but not Biology. 
<br><br>
<strong>What medical school did you got to and why did you choose that one?</strong><br>
Manchester. I can't remember if it's the same now but you used to apply for 5 universities. Leeds asked me for 3 A's and I got 2 A's and  B and in the end Manchester was left. So it was chosen for me. I don't think there's much difference between the medical schools. I think it's a question of choosing the city because they should all be as good as each other as in the end doctors should all be qualified wherever they're working.
<br><br>
<strong>And what qualifications did you do to become a GP?</strong><br>
Usually after five years at medical school you have to do one years internship and after that to become a GP you have to do two more years in hospital. So those 2 years should really be a mixture of things like gynaecology, paediatrics, ENT, surgery, casualty, six months of each usually. Then after those two years you do one year in a General Practice with a senior GP as a trainer and at the end of that you're qualified.
So after medical school: one year of internship, two years of hospital medicine (different things) then one year in a GP practise. It takes quite a long time! At the end of the GP training year, the last year, you have to do a few things: you have to do an audit, you have to be assessed by the trainer, you have to do an exam as well.
<br><br>
<strong>What's the exam testing you for?</strong><br>
The exam is basically a written exam testing you on everything in medicine. You can also do a special qualification which is the MRCGP which stands for Membership of the Royal College of GPs. Many GPs don't have it but nowadays younger GPs tend to do it. There are lots of components to it such as an oral exam and a video of yourself seeing patients. The examiners watch it and see if you're doing it well.

	 <strong>And where can your career go from here? What's the next step?</strong><br>
General Practise is changing quite a bit. Now The government and the health authorities are encouraging GPs to have sub specialties which means you do mostly General Practise but then you choose a sub-specialty which could be gynaecology, ENT, skin problems etc. Many GPs now are training in that sort of thing. So they attend some skin clinics and get more experience of that. It's mainly to do with waiting lists so rather than the patient waiting a year to see the dermatologist, you can see a GP who's got some experience in skin diseases. I'm looking into it but I must say I'm not sure if that's what I want to do. I enjoy being a GP and I didn't choose to be a hospital specialist. But that's the way its going nowadays.. specialising within general practise.
<br><br>
<strong>Do you have any advice for children thinking of becoming GPs?</strong><br>
Obviously they would have to choose medicine first and then decide if they wanted to be GPs. I think when I went to medical school and did my house jobs it was very different from what I expected. It's definitely hard work.. the house jobs especially. But I don't regret doing it.It is hard but I think it's definitely worth it in the end. You'll never run out of doctors.. it's one thing to look at because if you do a degree and you don't have a job at the end of it I think it's very frustrating but with General Practise at the moment and medicine in general, you're almost guaranteed a job in this country for many years to come. So that's one factor as well.. you will be able to be a GP.. you won't be unemployed which is very frustrating if you've spent so many years studying.
