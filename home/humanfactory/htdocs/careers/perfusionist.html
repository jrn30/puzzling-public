<strong>Can you tell me your official job title?</strong><br>
Deputy Clinical Manager but my role is that of Clinical Perfusionist.<br><br>
<strong>What do you do?</strong><br>
Primarily we are involved with the intervention of the circulation. Any medical procedure that involves any changes to the circulation of blood then you're likely to find a perfusionist. But the vast majority of our work is involved in cardiac surgery where we'll be operating heart/lung machines which is a machine used to support the patient's circulation whilst the heart has been arrested. Here at Great Ormond St Hospital we deal mostly with malformations of the heart.. hole in the heart surgery that kind of thing.<br><br>
<strong>How long have you been a clinical perfusionist?</strong><br>
Seven years now. The first two and a half years as a trainee.<br><br>
<strong>And what's your typical day?</strong><br>
A typical day starts at 7:30 or 7:45. I come in, check that the operating list is the same as the evening before so we don't set up for the wrong patient. Then I go to the ward and read the patient's case notes and details and make sure there are no surprises waiting for us with this particular patient. Then we'll assemble and prime the heart/lung machine. They bring the patient down to the anaesthetic room about 8:15. At this hospital, because a lot of our children are quite unstable and very sick, the policy is that we try to have the machines ready for when they are given their anaesthetic. Going from fully conscious and often quite stressed to fully unconscious can do funny things to your cardio-vascular system and occasionally they have a cardiac arrest. So we try to be as ready as we can, just in case. <br>
Then we have a little rest while the patient is put onto the operating table and the surgery begins. They'll get the chest open and dissect all the tissues. We'll have a cup of tea and some toast during that time. Then when they're ready for the main intervention part of the operation, we'll come in and run the machine for that. The surgeon will insert canulae (large drips) into the big veins around the heart and the aorta. These are connected to the tubing of the heart/lung bypass machine. Then we bypass the heart.. we drain all the blood out of the body, away from the heart, put it through an artificial lung and pump it back into the aorta. We're trying to take over the function of the heart and the lungs. <br><br>

<strong>So how long are you in the operating theatre for?</strong><br>
It depends. If it's for a small hole in the heart it can be 30 - 40 minutes. If it's for major reconstructive surgery on a small, newborn baby then it can be anything up to 7 or 8 hours. Nonstop. During the day you have colleagues available for support if you're really hungry or need a loo break. But at night and at the weekends when you're on call you're the only person so you can be in the operating room for a very long time with no chance of a break. The average length of a cardiac operation door to door is about 4 - 5 hours.<br><br>

<strong>What happens after your morning surgery?</strong><br>
Due to the nature of the surgery that's done in this institution, we just do two open-heart procedures in an operating theatre in a day. So after the first operation I'll have some lunch if I can get it. I don't actually have a scheduled lunch break I just try and grab a sandwich when I can. Then, depending on staffing levels and what's on the list, I'll do it all again and do another case in the afternoon. Or my colleague will do that and I'll be available for support.<br>

Often there are things going on in the intensive care unit. There are other life support machines for the circulation that we use in intensive care that need to be kept going. Often components need to be changed out of those, or the whole circuit. So every day we'll always go onto the intensive care unit and check on the patient's that we've got there. Then there's the administration and the stock ordering to do and the maintenance of the machines.
<br><br>
<strong>How many days a week do you work?</strong><br>
I have a 37-hour, standard contract per week. However, patients don't pay much attention to that and tend to get sick at the strangest times of day and at weekends. There has to be cover for this service 24 hours a day every single day of the year without question. We're a fairly small, specialised unit. At the moment we've got only three staff so we're on call every third day and every third weekend. We get paid extra for that but it does interrupt your social life a bit. Last month I had seventy hours of over time.

<strong>What's the most rewarding moment of your job so far?</strong><br>
It's a tremendously rewarding area to be working in. It's endlessly fascinating work to be involved with. And the calibre of people who are my close colleagues is quite intimidatingly high. I work with 2 world-renowned Professors of Paediatric Cardiac Surgery. The anaesthetists I work alongside are some of the finest in the country, if not the World. They are very motivated, intelligent and highly skilled people and the work itself is of the calibre that challenges those guys. It's very rewarding to be in that kind of lofty environment in terms of professionalism and level of intellect that you're surrounded by. Also you've got the personal satisfaction of knowing that you're doing something which contributes to society in a useful and positive way. In spite of the occasional bad outcomes and stress and long hours that you work, you still manage to sleep at night because you've got a clear conscience. I'd say that's one of the nicest parts of it.<br><br>

<strong>On the other hand, what do you dislike most about your job?</strong><br>
My bleeper. It does interrupt your social life. But having said that, the situation we've got with the on-call in our department imposes on you more than you'd find in any other hospital, just because of the small staffing numbers. <br><br>

<strong>How did you become a perfusionist?</strong><br>
I didn't do medicine. I dropped out of my Psychology degree. I had no idea what I did want to do so I didn't even think about doing other courses. Then i was working on building sites as a general labourer and thinking about what I was actually going to do. During this time there was a job advert to train as an Anaesthetic Technician. I applied for that because it said that if you were interviewed then you'd have a day being shown round the operating theatres and I applied simply because I wanted to see a real operation and I though it would be amazing! I was offered an interview, was shown round and I did see a real operation. From that moment onwards I was absolutely struck by it and I knew that I'd found a professional arena in which I wanted to stay. I did the course ( a two year City and Guilds) and I got a job being an Anaesthetic Technician in cardiac surgery. I was working in cardiac surgery and obviously you've got Perfusionists working in there alongside you. As I became aware of the limitations with the role and qualification that I had, I became more interested in Clinical Perfusion and started investigating the training for that and started applying for jobs.<br><br>

 

<strong>What is the training?</strong><br>
To get yourself onto the register of Clinical Perfusion Scientists in the British isles, you have to have three things:
1. A degree in Clinical Science (Perfusion) which lasts either two or four years depending on whether or not you already have a relevant degree. You can only be accepted onto that course if you are employed as a trainee perfusionist at a training hospital. So if you get the job you'll be sent on this course. 
2. You need a minimum of two years clinical training i.e. on the job training
3. And during that time you have to perform 150 cases under supervision <br><br>

<strong>Where can your career go from here?</strong><br>
The High Court probably! They say there's two types of perfusionist; ones who have been to court and ones who haven't yet. You are that directly responsible. One mistake and you could kill the patient within seconds. You have to know exactly what to do, keep a cool head and respond appropriately in an emergency. They do happen.<br>

One of the interesting aspects of this area is that it's highly specialised which means your skills are quite rare and sought after particularly in the developing world. So I've been lucky enough to go and work on charitable missions to Morrocco, Nicaragua and Iran. It's interesting and very challenging.<br><br>

<strong>What skills and abilities are important to your job?</strong><br>
To be able to concentrate at a very high level without a break for considerable periods of time. Keep your mind on your tasks and not allow any outside influences affect your performance. This becomes a very easy thing to do when you consider the implications of not doing that. The prospect of making mistakes should terrify you. You've got to be able to assimilate lots of different kinds of information into a cohesive whole. The closest analogy to running a heart/lung machine is being the pilot of an aeroplane.<br><br> 

<strong>Do you have any advice to people thinking of becoming a perfusionist?</strong><br>
Do it! It's endlessly fascinating and I'm looking forward to doing this to the end of my working life. I don't think there's any other professional arena that gives me the rewards and challenges that I've got. I consider myself very privileged to be able to do this kind of work.<br><br>
