<br>
<strong>How long have you been a nurse?</strong><br>
I've been a nurse for six years<br><br>
<strong>What hours do you work normally?</strong><br>
I work 8 'til 4 or 12 'til 8, five days a week.<br><br>

<strong>What's your typical day?</strong><br>
We have a nursing hand-over in the morning from the night staff to the day staff and we discuss the conditions and the plans for each patient for the day.<br><br>


<strong>What made you decide on becoming a nurse?</strong><br>
I was working in a nursing home and I really enjoyed it but the pay was appalling. So I thought "Well, I'll try doing nursing". So I did the training and I enjoyed that so I thought I'd carry on.<br><br>

<strong>What kind of training did you do to become a nurse?</strong><br>
I did a three-year diploma at City University [London]. You need four GCSEs...so you don't need much. You can do it as a degree but you get a bursary if you do it as a diploma. That means you don't have to pay fees and you get paid.. I think it's about &pound;500 a month to do it. I already had a degree (in English) so I decided to do the diploma. You can get a degree as part of your professional development once you become a nurse. Most nurses, if they've done the diploma, are on their degree pathway. Your diploma makes up about a third of your degree so then you do degree level courses to top that up to a degree. Most nurses in the hospital are probably on that.<br><br>

<strong>What did you enjoy most about the diploma?</strong><br>
It's not just about nursing. You do Psychology, Sociology. You do Public Policy - that sounds boring actually but it's good! And you also do clinical placements in all different hospitals, in lots of different settings. So you might do maternity, mental health, medical, surgical, A&amp;E. All sorts of different things.<br><br>

<strong>So the diploma didn't specialise in one particular area?</strong><br>
The diploma only specialises in either child, adult or mental health nursing but you still do a little bit of each regardless of which one you specialise in. Mine was an adult nursing diploma. There's also a learning disabilities diploma but they didn't offer that at City University.<br><br>

<strong>How did you end up deciding on doing care for the elderly?</strong><br>
Because I used to work in a nursing home before I did my nurse training, I always thought I might do care of the elderly, and I have! Part of it is just that the job came up, but the thing with nursing is that so many jobs come up that you can really pick and choose what you want. But care of the elderly is good because the patients are in for a longer time, you can build up relationships with them as opposed to people being in for a couple of days for an appendix or something. So they're in for up to about three weeks and you can get a relationship going with them and they're multi-pathology so there's lots of things going on at once as opposed to one specific condition.  They're quite high dependency as well so they require lots of nursing care.<br><br>

<strong>What was the most difficult thing about the course?</strong><br>
Doing the course work while you're also working full-time. You're working full-time on the wards for six months of the year, but you also have to do your essays on top of that, which is quite hard.<br><br>

	<strong>How does your job differ from that of a different type of nurse?</strong><br>
I'm always in charge of the shift. So, there's the ward manager then there are 2 F- grades. Nurses have grades. So your basic trained nurse is a D grade then you have a senior staff nurse, which is an E-grade, then you have Junior Charge nurse or junior sister, which is me which is an F and then your ward manager is a G. So there should always be an F or a G on every shift or every day because you have to be able to direct the other staff. If any problems come up with staff for example if people are off sick, you have to anticipate that. But you also have to bear in mind your budget because hospitals are very tight with their money. Which is fair enough! Having these blue epaulettes, people always come to you first. Even if a patient's been looked at by another nurse, they always come to you. If there's ever a problem the relatives always come to you as opposed to the staff nurses. And the same with hospital staff, they'll always come to you first. Which is fine but you have your own patients at the same time.<br><br>


<strong>So you've only been a nurse for six years, which doesn't sound like a lot and yet you've got quite a senior position.</strong><br>
Yes. In London you're more likely to be promoted more quickly because the turnover of staff is much higher. So, generally speaking, you'd probably expect to be one grade for about two years roughly speaking. Whereas in the country you might be a basic grade staff nurse for ten years.<br><br>

<strong>Would you be in the position you are today if you hadn't gone into Higher Education?</strong><br>
No. You have to do the diploma or a degree in Nursing Studies.<br><br>

<strong>What do you dislike about your job?</strong><br>
Pay, the state of the hospital and the staffing levels. Policy things rather than things specific to the job itself.<br><br>

<strong>
What's been the most rewarding moment of your job so far?</strong><br>
Anytime when you have a cardiac arrest or a patient dies so they either stop breathing or their heart stops, then if you can bring them back on the ward, that's always good.<br><br>

<strong>What skills and abilities are important in your job?</strong><br>
Generally in nursing you need to be able to prioritise, you need to be good at communication, you have to be able to be organised, have good clinical skills so you have to have good nursing knowledge. In this job you need good personnel management skills and you need to have an awareness of things like budgets and national policies.<br><br>

<strong>Where can your career go from here?</strong><br>
Well the next step up from me would be to be Ward Manager and from that you could be either the Lead Nurse for a directorate, say the Lead Nurse for Medicine in the hospital, or you could become a Nurse Specialist in something like stroke or care of the elderly. Really there are so many different jobs and so many opportunities that if you do a lot of training then you can do pretty much whatever you want. There are also lots of opportunities to do courses towards getting a nursing degree or a Masters in nursing or a PhD in nursing.<br><br>

<strong>Do you have any advice to people thinking about becoming a nurse?</strong><br>
Don't do it straight from school because most student nurses who come straight from school don't finish the course. The academic side is not very difficult - it's a diploma and you only need four G.C.S.Es (it's just a bit more than an A-level standard) but they struggle to do the coursework and the placements. If you're young it can be a bit of a shock to deal with death and complaints and aggressive patients and aggressive relatives. So, I wouldn't do it straight from school. Go on to Higher Education and get a bit of life experience as well. I'd definitely recommend doing some sort of science A-level.
