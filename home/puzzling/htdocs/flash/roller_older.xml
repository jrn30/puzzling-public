<page graphic="example0">This is a game where you can design your own roller-coaster.</page>
<page graphic="example1">Roller-coasters are trains that run along rising and falling tracks. The trains are pulled up to the highest point and then allowed to run down the track, powered by nothing other than gravity.</page>
<page graphic="example2">In an upward turn the track exerts a large radial force on the roller-coaster. This is a centripetal force and causes a change in direction of the train. The acceleration in the turn is often measured in g, where 1g is that due to gravity (9.8 ms-2).</page>
<page graphic="example3">Similarly, in a downward turn the roller-coaster is pulled downwards by the track.</page>
<page graphic="example4">The acceleration felt in the turns is what makes the roller-coaster exciting to the passengers. Accelerations larger than 1g in either direction will cause a rush of excitement.</page>
<page graphic="example5">Too much acceleration may make the passenger sick, or even pass out, as it restricts the flow of blood inside the body.</page>
<page graphic="example6">When designing your roller-coaster, bear in mind the acceleration at each point. The tighter the curve, the higher the acceleration. But don't go too far - more than 5g in the turn is considered harmful.</page>
<page graphic="example7">You will get points for your course - the higher the acceleration your passengers experience safely, the more points you will get. But if your passengers become ill or pass out, you will lose points.</page>
<page>Remember, the train will slow down slightly due to friction as it runs along the track. The height of the hills it can climb will therefore get smaller - it can never go higher than the starting point!</page>
<page graphic="example8">To design your roller-coaster, drag the grey boxes up and down to change the bends of the track, then click 'Test' to try out your design.</page>
<page>You start with a simple roller-coaster, if you get enough points you will progress to the next level. The higher the level, the bigger and steeper your roller-coaster can become.</page>
