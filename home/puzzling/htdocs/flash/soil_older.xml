  <page graphic="example0">One of the factors that influence plants is the acidity (pH) of the soil they grow in. This affects the chemical reactions which help plants take in nutrients.</page> 
  <page graphic="example1">If soil is too acidic, plants cannot take certain nutrients like calcium and magnesium, while they take up too much of poisons like aluminium, which will stunt their growth.</page> 
  <page graphic="example2">Similarly, if soil is too alkaline, plants cannot take up iron or zinc, which will also stunt their growth.</page> 
  <page graphic="example3">In this game, you are given a patch of land, and you have to grow some plants on it - tomatoes, rhododendrons and blueberries.</page> 
  <page graphic="example3">Different plants have different requirements - some might like very acid soil (pH 4-5), others less acid (pH 6-7).</page> 
  <page graphic="example5">If the pH of the soil is too acidic, you will need to alter it by adding lime. Lime is a mixture of minerals including calcium carbonate, which is alkaline.</page> 
  <page graphic="example5">By adding lime, you make the soil more alkaline and so increase the pH. The more lime, the more alkaline you will make the soil. Without lime, the soil will slowly turn acidic.</page> 
  <page graphic="example6">At the start, drag the universal indicator paper onto the soil to test its current pH. Give the demonstration on the left a go!</page> 
  <page graphic="example7">You can compare the colour of the paper to the chart provided.</page> 
  <page graphic="example8">Once you have worked out the pH, add the amount of lime you think is needed for the plants to grow properly for the following year.</page> 
  <page graphic="example9">Carry on doing this year-by-year until you find an ideal pH for your plants. You should aim for at least 95% growth continually for several years. </page>
