<page graphic="example0">In this game you have to mix three colours to produce a target colour. There are two parts: Light and paint.</page>
<page graphic="example0">In the first part, light, you control the brightness of three spotlights - one of each of the primary colours - red, green and blue. Mixing different amounts of these three colours can make every other colour.</page>
<page graphic="example0" frame="5">Here, a red colour is made of just red light.</page>
<page graphic="example0" frame="10">Here, we make yellow from a mixture of red and green light.
Red and blue light make magenta (pink).
Green and blue light make cyan (turquoise).</page>
<page graphic="example0" frame="25">Equal amounts of all three colours at maximum brightness (100%) will produce white light, or grey if the brightness is lowered.</page>
<page graphic="example0" frame="20">If there isn't much difference between the brightness of the three colours, the result is often a pale shade of the brighter colour. Here the green is slightly brighter than the red and blue.</page>
<page graphic="example0" frame="15">The darker a colour, the less light is used - so the lower the brightness level of the spotlight.</page>
<page graphic="example1">Use the sliders to change the brightness of the red, green and blue spotlights. When the colour of the central triangle matches the target, you've won.

<page graphic="example2" frame="0">In the second part, we use splodges of paint rather than light. There are three colours - cyan, magenta and yellow.</page>
<page graphic="example2" frame="5">Each paint colour is the opposite of a light colour - here, cyan is a mixture of blue and green. Cyan paint is the opposite of red light - it absorbs red light, but reflects blue and green.Similarly, magenta is the opposite of green, and yellow is the opposite of blue.</page>
<page graphic="example2" frame="10">When we combine paint colours, we absorb all the light the paints absorb. A mixture of cyan and yellow paint reflects only green light and appears green.</page>
<page graphic="example2" frame="12">A mixture of cyan and magenta is blue.
A mixture of magenta and yellow is red.</page>
<page graphic="example2" frame="15">If we use a little paint, the the colour produced is quite light, as we don't absorb much light. A mixture of equal amounts of all three colours absorbs all three primary colours and is therefore grey or black.</page>
