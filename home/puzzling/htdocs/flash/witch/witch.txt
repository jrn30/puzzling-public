fact1=<font color="#FFFFFF" size="18" face="serif">In a time when the daily wages were commonly as little as 2.5p, Hopkins was making £15 to £23 per town cleansed of witches.  He was successful enough to employ two assistants - Mary Philips (an ex mid wife) and John Stearn (a failed preacher).<BR>The three of them would meet at the <font color="#FF0000">Thorn Inn</font>, in Mistley, where they would collect gossip that they then turned into formal accusations. In the end, Hopkins was perhaps too successful: pamphlets were produced condemning him and even hinting that he himself was a witch. Some accounts say that he was eventually hanged for that crime (others say he died in his bed of tuberculosis).<BR><font color="#FF0000">Thorn Inn</font> still exists today and can be visited.</font>
&fact3=<font color="#FFFFFF" size="18" face="serif">'Swimming the Witch' was another cruel method used to find out if a person was a witch invented by Hopkins first assistant, <font color="#FF0000">John Stearn.</font> The suspect (more likely to be a woman) had her thumbs tied to her toes before being thrown into the river. If she drowned she was declared a good christian and an innocent. If she managed to float, she was pulled out of the water and hanged straight away for being impure and therefore a witch. In either case the suspect was doomed to die.</font>
&fact4=<font color="#FFFFFF" size="18" face="serif">Within a two-year span, Hopkins had executed more than 200 people. Hopkins' favourite method of execution was <font color="#FF0000">hanging</font>. Many people thought he burned witches (as they did in France and Germany), but only four to five burnings took place in East Anglia during the witch-hunt craze.</font>
&fact5=<font color="#FFFFFF" size="18" face="serif">On the <font color="#FF0000">Isles of Wight</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Man</font>, people verified the authenticity of a witch by putting her to the '<font color="#FF0000">Barrel and Knives test</font>'. The witch was put inside a barrel, knives were pushed through the side toward the center of the barrel and the barrel was rolled down a steep hill. If the witch was still alive when the barrel reached the bottom of the hill, she was innocent otherwise she was a witch - but a dead one, thank goodness!</font>
&fact6=<font color="#FFFFFF" size="18" face="serif">In Netherland, at <font color="#FF0000">Oudewater</font>, a suspect could request the '<font color="#FF0000">weight test</font>'. Since it was believed that witches flew around on broomsticks, logic had it that a witch's body must be incredibly light. If the suspect passed the test (that is if they weighed a reasonable weight compared to their height) then they were given a certificate <font color="#FF0000">acquitting</font> (not condemning!) them of witchcraft for the rest of their life. Needless to say, not long after this became known, people from all over Europe requested the test in order to obtain a certificate.</font>
&fact7=<font color="#FFFFFF" size="18" face="serif">In 1692 at <font color="#FF0000">Salem</font>, Massachusetts, no less than 140 people were arrested. Among these people 19 were hanged and one was tortured to death. It is the biggest and most famous <font color="#FF0000">'witchcraft panic' outbreak</font> in America. It is believed now that merciless, rich, land owners used their daughters to accuse innocent people so that their land could be sold off cheaply.</font>
&fact8=<font color="#FFFFFF" size="18" face="serif">Ruthless enforcers were in operation across Europe, implementing laws put in place to ensure that witches were not left alive to work their mischief - Spain had the Spanish <font color="#FF0000">Inquisition</font>, and Germany had the <font color="#FF0000">Vehrmacht</font> or the English <font color="#FF0000">Witchfinders</font>. They all used the same method to make a suspect speak: TORTURE. With the exception of England, witch-hunters in Europe took their authority from the <font color="#FF0000">church</font>. In England however, <font color="#FF0000">the civil</font> courts rather than <font color="#FF0000">the ecclesiastic ones</font> prosecuted witches.</font>
&fact9=<font color="#FFFFFF" size="18" face="serif">Just how many 'witches' were killed is not known for sure.  Some estimates are as low as a few thousand, others as high as nine million. There are surviving records of prosecutions, and throughout Europe prosecutions amounted to something like 110,000 between 1450 and1750. <font color="#FF0000">Scandinavia</font> is recorded as having no less than half a million of witches put to death. However, it is possible that these records are not complete, or alternatively that the authorities at the time exaggerated the number to enhance their reputation for piety.</font>
&fact10=<font color="#FFFFFF" size="18" face="serif">Depending on the time and place in which they were caught, for those accused of witchcraft torture was certainly very common as a means of extracting a confession. Once a confession had been obtained, they were often tortured again to make them reveal the names of other witches they knew. Finally, they would be executed.</font> 
&fact11=<font color="#FFFFFF" size="18" face="serif">The 'Malleus maleficarum' (which is Latin for 'The Witch Hammer') was a Roman Catholic handbook for judges that had been appointed to examine witches.  It mentions several methods for determining whether someone was a witch.</font>  
&fact12=<font color="#FFFFFF" size="18" face="serif">In continental Europe, they were usually burnt.  This was the usual punishment for anyone whose crime was perceived as being against the church - it was not enough to kill heretics - the only way to purge them of heresy was to destroy their whole body.</font>
&fact13=<font color="#FFFFFF" size="18" face="serif">Unlike the rest of Europe, England hanged its witches.  This was because witchcraft was tried in the civil courts and not the ecclesiastical ones.</font>
&fact14=<font color="#FFFFFF" size="18" face="serif">Other methods of determining whether someone was a witch included:
- Stripping the accused and shaving off all the hair on their body to see whether they were hiding any 'instruments of witchcraft'. 
- Telling them to shed tears - it was believed that witches were incapable of crying.  But how many people can cry on demand?</font>
&fact2=<font color="#FFFFFF" size="18" face="serif">Methods of torture included:
- Threatening to burn them with red-hot irons if they did not confess.  Witches were thought to be immune to the pain of fire, so if they refused to confess at this stage, it was taken as evidence that they were guilty (and of course if they did confess, that was taken as evidence they were guilty too!)
- Torturing them.  One method mentioned is the strappado - their hands would be tied behind their back and they would be suspended by their wrists.  Sometimes heavy weights would be tied to their feet.  If enough weights were added, this would result in death.</font>
